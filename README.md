Hey everyone,
<br>
Ever thought about what would you do if there was no StackOverflow? How hard and time-consuming would it be to rectify your errors every time by going into those huge documentations associated with the languages or frameworks you’d be using? or 
What if interaction with the community was not so easy as it is today?
<br>
Developers needn’t be reminded of the importance of websites like StackOverflow or the interaction with the community, we all are well aware of that.
<br>
I have been noticing that there is a lack of a “developers community” in our college group.
So i decided to make a website that would allow students to form a community that will resolve any problems/errors/doubts related to the technology.
students can post their questions on this website, and the people who are good enough or have faced the same problem before can help by answering their questions, in the comments section.
<br>
I have used MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS i.e. the MERN stack for making this project.
<br>
Let’s have a look at the website.
<br>
<ul>
<li>node version: 14.3.0</li>
<li>npm version: 6.14.5</li>
</ul>
<br> 
Remember to install the important dependencies, Here’s the list of dependencies used for client and server.
<ul>
<li>Get the dependencies for server side from <a href="https://github.com/RaiLokesh/slight-app/blob/master/client/package.json">package.json</a>
<li>Get the dependencies for client side from <a href="https://github.com/RaiLokesh/slight-app/blob/master/package.json">package.json</a>
</ul>
